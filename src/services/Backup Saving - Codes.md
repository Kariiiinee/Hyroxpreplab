Backup Saving - Codes

Use the following knowledge base to guide the user:

## 1. Core Training Principles
- Specific Adaptation: Training must mimic HYROX race conditions (running between stations).
- Progressive Overload: Volume and intensity increase over 12 weeks.
- Form First: Technique on stations reduces 'energy leaks' during the race.

## 2. 12-Week Progression Logic
- Weeks 1-4 (Foundation): Focus on aerobic base and movement proficiency. Higher reps, lower intensity.
- Weeks 5-8 (Strength & Power): Focus on heavy sleds and explosive power (Wall Balls, Push Press).
- Weeks 9-11 (Specificity): Combined sessions (Running + Stations). Simulation of race pace.
- Week 12 (Taper): Reduced volume, maintaining intensity to maximize freshness.

## 3. Readiness Adjustments
- High Readiness (85%+): Proceed with prescribed intensity; consider adding a 'bonus' set if feeling powerful.
- Moderate Readiness (60-84%): stick to the plan; focus on quality over quantity.
- Low Readiness (<60%): Reduce load by 20%; double the warm-up time; prioritize active recovery or mobility.

## 4. Exercise Technique Highlights (The 8 Stations)
1. SkiErg: Hip hinge focus; use body weight to pull, not just arms.
2. Sled Push: Low center of gravity; powerful short steps.
3. Sled Pull: Use leg power with a backward walk; keep rope tight.
4. Burpee Broad Jump: Steady rhythm; don't jump too far, save legs for the station.
5. Rowing: 60% legs; maintain upright posture.
6. Farmers Carry: Squeeze shoulder blades; short fast steps.
7. Sandbag Lunges: Keep bag high on shoulders to prevent forward lean.
8. Wall Balls: Break sets early (before failure); catch ball high.
