    { title: "SkiErg", category: "Race Stations", description: "Pulling on a machine mimicking double-pole skiing for 1,000m.", technique: "Hinge at the hips and drive your chest downward; uses whole body, not just arms." },
    { title: "Sled Push", category: "Race Stations", description: "Pushing a heavily loaded sled across carpet for 50m.", technique: "Keep body low, arms locked/close, and take short, powerful steps. Don't let the sled stop." },
    { title: "Sled Pull", category: "Race Stations", description: "Using a rope to pull a heavy sled toward you for 50m while inside a box.", technique: "Use a \"backward walk\" or \"hip drive\" (lean back and use leg weight). Drop slack to the side." },
    { title: "Burpee Broad Jumps", category: "Race Stations", description: "Chest-to-floor burpee followed by a forward jump (80m total).", technique: "Step feet up from the bottom instead of jumping to save energy. Focus on a steady rhythm." },
    { title: "Rowing", category: "Race Stations", description: "1,000m on a rowing machine (full-body cardio).", technique: "Power primarily with legs (60%), followed by hips and arms. Use as active recovery." },
    { title: "Farmers Carry", category: "Race Stations", description: "Walking 200m while holding a heavy kettlebell in each hand.", technique: "Stand tall, chest proud, shoulders packed down. Take short, quick strides to stop swinging." },
    { title: "Sandbag Lunges", category: "Race Stations", description: "Walking lunges for 100m with a weighted sandbag on the upper back.", technique: "Keep torso upright; back knee must clearly touch the ground. Never take sandbag off." },
    { title: "Wall Balls", category: "Race Stations", description: "Squatting and throwing a weighted medicine ball to hit a target (100 reps).", technique: "Break into sets (e.g., 4x25). Ensure hip crease goes below knees. Catch on the way down." },
    // Strength & Power
    { title: "Deadlifts", category: "Strength & Power", description: "Heavy lift off the floor by hinging at the hips.", technique: "Maintain a horizontal torso lean to mimic sled pull mechanics." },
    { title: "Pause Back Squats", category: "Strength & Power", description: "Barbell squat with a held pause at the bottom.", technique: "Hold tension at the bottom (hip crease below knees) before driving powerfully up." },
    { title: "Push Press", category: "Strength & Power", description: "Overhead press using a slight leg dip and drive.", technique: "Keep torso upright during the dip; squeeze glutes and punch weights straight overhead." },
    { title: "American KB Swings", category: "Strength & Power", description: "Dynamic hip-hinge swinging a KB from between legs to overhead.", technique: "Use explosive hip power; avoid pulling with arms. Finish with bell directly overhead." },
    { title: "Stationary/Split Lunges", category: "Strength & Power", description: "Single-leg strength building with a held or walking step.", technique: "Keep load centered over hips (proud chest); inhale as you descend, exhale as you rise." },
    { title: "Pull-ups", category: "Strength & Power", description: "Hanging from a bar and pulling up until chin clears it.", technique: "Start from a dead hang; pull shoulder blades down and back, drive elbows to sides." },
